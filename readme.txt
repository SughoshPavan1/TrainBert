This project fine-tunes the deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-base language model for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using the SuperGLUE WiC dataset.  Due to resource constraints, training is performed on CPU. The code utilizes the Hugging Face transformers and datasets libraries, along with torch. It loads the pre-trained model, tokenizes the WiC dataset, and fine-tunes the model for 3 epochs (adjustable in the script).  The model is saved to a directory named according to the experiment version (./wic_model_{EXPERIMENT_NAME}) to avoid overwriting previous runs.  The script also includes workarounds for AzureML compatibility, such as shortening output directory and evaluation/save strategy names, using float32 precision, and clearing the MLflow cache to prevent potential parameter conflicts. Because training is done on CPU it can be expected to be very slow.
